1.what is oop? list oops concept.

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. 
An object-oriented programming language uses objects in its programming. 
Programming with object-oriented concepts aims to emulate real-world concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc, in a program.


oop has six concept
1. class:
 	-class is a blue print of the object OR
	-class is the combination of the data member and member function
		->data member is a variable which was define in side the class
		->member function is a UDF which was define the class body
	#defination:- i) class is a colllection of the data-member and member-function
				 ii) class is a blueprint of the object. 
	-class is never occupied the memory
	-class can get memory by assignment of object but that memory is object's.
	-data-member is a variable which was defined inside that class.
	-member function is a function which was defined inside that class.
	# syntax:-  class class_name
				{
				
					/* data */
				};
2. object:
	-object is a instance of the class.

3. Abstraction:
	-used to hide the background detailfrom the user which unnecessary from the user
	-hide the background detail

4.Encapsulation:
	-wrapping up the data.
	
5.Inharitance
	-reusability of the code.

6.Polymorphism
	- one name many form

2. What is the difference between OOP and POP?

OOP VS POP

OOP is stands for the Object Oriented Programming
POP is stands for the procedure Oriented Programming

OOP give more important to the object
POP give more importance to the procedure

OOP is more secure than the POP
POP is less secure than OOP

OOP follows the bottom to top approach
POP follows the top to bottom approach

OOP is slower than the POP
POP is fast compare to OOP

OOP is complex than POP
POP is compare to OOP

OOP follows the object concept
POP follows the function
